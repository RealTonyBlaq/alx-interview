 This project is a measure towards preparing for Tech interviews.

In `0-pascal_triangle.py`, the function
 ```py
 def pascal_triangle(n):
 ```
was defined based on:
- i

 - To run this program:

 ```shell
./0-main.py <number>
 ```

 - Example:

 ```shell
$ ./0-main.py 5
 ```

* Output

```shell
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 3, 3, 1]
[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
```
